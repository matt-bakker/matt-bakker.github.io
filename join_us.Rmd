I am currently recruiting for a [master's student position] (media/Fusarium_MaltingBarley_MScPosition_UManitoba.pdf), with research to address microbiomes of malting barley and connections to *Fusarium graminearum*.

I am also happy to assist motivated students and post-docs who are interested in pursuing their own funding sources.
