I am currently recruiting for a [master's student position](media/Fusarium_MaltingBarley_MScPosition_UManitoba.pdf {:target="_blank"}), with research to address microbiomes of malting barley and connections to *Fusarium graminearum*.  
  
I anticipate openings for a couple more students in the next few months, so please [get in touch](contact.html) if you have ideas.  
I am happy to assist motivated students and post-docs who are interested in pursuing their own funding sources.
