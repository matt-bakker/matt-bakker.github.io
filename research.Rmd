Research in the Bakker lab investigates plant-microbe interactions and plant-associated microbiomes, particularly in relation to agricultural productivity and sustainability.  
Some of our current study systems include:

# Fusarium head blight of small grains

```
One of the important functions performed by plant-associated microbiomes is the suppression of plant pathogens. We use the plant disease fusarium head blight as a model system for study of microbiome-pathogen interactions. This disease is economically costly, and is associated with accumulation of mycotoxins that create a food safety hazard.

Malting is a process of controlled germination that is used to stimulate enzymes within barley seeds to begin converting starch into sugars. While not the target of management, there is also a lot of microbial activity that takes place during malting. We study microbiome dynamics during malting, particularly with connections to the activity of *Fusarium* spp., which have been linked to some malt quality defects.
